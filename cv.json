This board handles much of the shutdown logic within the high voltage realm, which will disconnect the isolation relays and shut off all power in a dangerous event. In this case, that includes making sure that there is sufficient isolation between the tractive system and GLV ground (IMD), there is no overtemperature or over/under voltage event within the accumulator (BMS), or if the master switch is turned off (TSMS). In addition, this board prevents massive inrush current destroying the inverter using a precharge resistor. This baord also includes drivers for lights indicating that there is voltage in the tractive system (TSSI) and that the car is ready to move (RTML).",

Other important considerations at this stage were that we wanted our system to be more robust than last year. Due to the daisy-chained nature of our module wires, it was easy for some data to be lost due to a wire being unplugged, wasting about an hour each time. To avoid this, I decided to implement a looped communication design such that any one break of wire within the data can be accounted for. "
